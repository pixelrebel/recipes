### Instructions:
In a large dutch oven, saute onions in olive oil until it just starts to brown.  While onions are cooking, remove sausage from casing and hand mix with ground beef in a separate bowl.  Press garlic into onions and add dried oregano and half of the tomato paste.  Cook for 5 minutes until aromatic. Add meat and cook until pink (do not pour out the fat).  

While the meat is cooking, cut canned tomatoes into 4-6 pieces.  Add the remaining tomato paste and basil, followed shortly by the tomatoes (diced, including the sauce). Add all the remaining ingredients: wine, butter, honey, vinegar, anchovy paste, mushrooms, oregano springs and bay leaf.  Add salt to taste (about 3-4 tbs).  Add fresh ground pepper to taste (about 0.25 tsp) and red pepper flakes to taste (about 0.5 tsp).

Simmer for 2 hours with lid on, stirring occasionally.  If needed, remove lid for the last 15-20 minutes thicken. Remove bay leaves and oregano sprigs before serving.
