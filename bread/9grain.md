# Nine Grain Rustic Bread

The trick to making flavorful artisan bread is to take your time and let the yeast do all the work.
Aside from salt, the ingredients aren't really contributing to flavor.  Yeast puts off some tasty 
compounds when it is in growth mode.  We use a preferment to create these flavors.  A pinch of yeast 
into 100% hydration dough at cool temperatures creates an environment where the yeast have to 
struggle to reproduce. In that struggle, they fart and piss some tasty bready flavors.  

By the time the yeast have consumed the poolish (18-24 hours at room temp, 48-72 hours at 50°F), 
they will have doubled many times over and are quite vigorous.  You almost don't need to add any more
yeast for the bulk fermentation, but if you're in a rush, it doesn't hurt to add a couple pinches. 


### Grains:

- chopped rye
- chopped wheat
- chopped barley (or flaked)
- cut oats
- millet
- quinoa
- polenta
- amaranth 
- flaxseed

Have fun with this part.  I have no idea what the best ratio is for grains.
Just go easy on the polenta and wheat/barley berries.
Soak the grains in water with a tablespoon of molasses for at least 4 hours.
Drain the wet grains thoroughly and measure out about 150g (more or less) 
to add to the poolish. Since the grains are hydrated, you can easily adjust this amount without 
throwing off the overall hydration ratio.

### Poolish (preferment):

- 100g AP flour (I like King Arthur brand)
- 50g  Sprouted rye flour (substitute whole wheat if necessary)
- 150g Water
- 150g Wet grains
- The tiniest pinch of yeast (less than a gram)

Let the poolish ferment covered at room temp for at least 18 hours.
It's better to let it ferment longer and cooler.  In the fridge for 48-72 hours works well.
When the poolish looks wet and bubbly like pancake batter, it's good to go.

### Main dough:

- 450g Poolish
- 240g AP flour
- 360g Bread flour
- 300g Whole Wheat flour
- 600g Water
- 20g  Salt
- 3g   Yeast

Add the poolish, water and yeast together. 
You don't need to mix much, just let it sit while you measure the dry ingredients.
Measure flours and whisk together.  Salt kills yeast, so hold off on salt until the end.

### In the stand mixer:
Add poolish/water/yeast mixture into your mixer.
Add half of the flour.
Run mixer on low and slowly add the last of the flour.
Add the salt once all the dough is incorporated.
Step up the speed to 2 and run for 4 mins.
Let the dough rest for 10-15 minutes.
Run the mixer again on speed 2 for 2-5 mins. 
Let the dough rest again for 5 mins before transferring to a large greased bowl.

### Bulk Fermentation:
If you want to speed this part up you can add a teaspoon of yeast and ferment in three hours 
on a warm day.  I like to use a similar strategy to the poolish and use minimal yeast, and 
keep the temperature low around 50°F, but a refrigerator is fine too. 
Twice during the bulk fermentation, gently fold the dough over itself and flip it (don't punch it).

### Shaping a boule:
Measure out the amount you want to use for a loaf (330g for 15cm bowl or small baguette, 1kg for a 
25cm bowl)

The key to a nice lift in your loaf is all in the gluten.  Whether it's a boule, batard or baguette,
you want to create tension on the surface while not deflating the center.  Before shaping, place your
piece of dough onto your surface and pat it gently into a thick flat square.  Breaking it off the 
main loaf made it tight, so let it rest and relax for ten minutes before proceeding.

Once it is soft, floppy and malleable, fold the dough like an envelope four times over itself making 
sure to stretch the gluten tight on the bottom. On the forth fold roll it over and briskly form it 
into a ball. 

[Here's a video example.](https://youtu.be/pmTPL2J8OZk)

Without much flour on your surface, pull the ball toward you, stretching the gluten on the top-center 
of the ball as it rolls under itself.  Turn 90° and repeat until you have fully rotated the ball a 
few times. The ball should be tight on the surface and suple in the center. Place into a floured bowl
seam side up.  If the seam starts to fall apart pull seam together and pinch it closed.  You should 
have a taught ball in the bowl.  

[This example uses a twist technique I also like to use.](https://youtu.be/45z18TtFijU?t=4m59s)

### Proofing:
Let proof at room temperature for about an hour or a refrigerator temps for a few hours.  There's no
set time, the dough has to be just right. When you press your finger into the dough it should leave 
an indentation and slowly pop back.  If it pops back too fast, it's under-proofed.  If it doesn't pop
back or starts to deflate, it's over-proofed.  It's better to under-proof than over-proof. If you 
over-proof, start over by reshaping and then proofing again.

### Baking:
Preheat oven to 500°F (get this going before proofing is finished)
You can use a pizza stone or a dutch oven.  I also use a spray bottle to add steam to the oven.

Briskly flip the proofing bowl onto a well-floured surface.  With a sharp wet knife, score the loaf 
at a shallow angle.  Carefully place the loaf onto your stone or in your hot dutch oven and close 
the lid.  After 10 minutes turn, the oven down to 450°F bake until brown crust (200°F in the center).
If using a dutch oven, take the loaf out and put it on the oven rack after 20-30 minutes.
If you shaped and proofed it right, it will balloon within minutes.  If not, it will still be 
delicious, just a little dense. 


Artisan bread recipes are simple, play with the ratios and create different styles:

White bread:
Replace whole wheat with AP.

Baguettes:
Use 100% AP with up to 80% hydration.

Pizza dough:
Add a few tablespoons of olive oil to baguette dough.
