# Naan

Servings: 12 naans

### Ingredients:

- 4 cups all purpose flour
- 2 tbs sugar
- 2 tsp salt
- 1 tsp yeast
- 0.5 cup plain yogurt
- 4 tbs extra virgin olive oil
- 1 cup warm water (about 100Â°F)

### Instructions:
If using active dry yeast, dissolve it in the lukewarm water and let it sit until frothy, about 10 minutes.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, yeast, salt. Set aside.

In a medium bowl, whisk together, the yogurt, olive oil, and warm water. Add the yogurt mixture to the dry ingredients and mix with a fork. Knead well. Let sit in a warm place for 1 to 1.5 hours, or until about doubled in size.

Divide dough into 12 equal pieces, roll about 1/8 in thick and cook 1-2 mins on a hot cast iron skillet.
