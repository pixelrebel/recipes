# Daal

### Ingredients:

- 1 lbs lentils
- 2 tsps turmeric
- 0.25 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 2 tsps cumin seeds
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2-3 cloves garlic, finely sliced
- 1-2 fresh green chillies, minced
- 1 tsp garam masala
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 2 tbs fresh ginger, finely grated
- 1 12oz can fire roasted tomatoes

### Instructions:
Place the lentils in a pan and cover with enough cold water to come to around two inches above their surface. Bring to the boil (skim off any scum that rises to the top), and reduce to a simmer. Stir in the turmeric and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Cover and leave to cook gently.

In a small frying pan, dry-fry the cumin seeds over a medium heat until toasted and fragrant (no more than a couple of minutes). Remove from the pan and set to one side.

Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil in the same frying pan and gently fry the chopped garlic, onion, chillies and the grated ginger and tomatoes, if youâ€™re using them. Once the garlic is golden, mix in the toasted cumin seeds, garam masala and ground coriander. Remove from the heat until the lentils are completely softened.

Add salt or soy sauce and additional olive oil to taste.
