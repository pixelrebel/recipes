# Spanish (Mexican) Rice

### Ingredients:

- 4 tbs vegetable or canola oil
- 2 cups dry long-grain white rice (about 1 lbs)
- 1 7oz can El Pato Salsa de Tomate con Jalape√±o (red can of sauce)
- 4 cups warm water
- 2 tsp chili powder
- 4 tsp Caldo de Tomate tomato bouillon
- 2 tsp minced garlic about 4 cloves

### Instructions:
Heat oil in a 5 quart dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add rice. Cook rice, stirring constantly, for several minutes, until rice begins to turn a golden color.

Reduce heat to low to avoid spattering. Gently pour in warm water, then tomato sauce and stir. Stir in chili powder, Caldo de Tomate and minced garlic. Turn heat back up to medium-high, bring to a boil, then reduce to low and cover. Simmer for 20 minutes, or until all water has been absorbed.

Turn off heat, fluff rice then let sit, covered, for 5-10 minutes before serving.  The resulting fluffed rice will nearly fill the 5 quart dutch oven.
